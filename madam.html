      Hey Madam, I wanted to do something for you so I did this. I don’t know where you were these days but thank god we both met. You’re the prettiest, most understanding gem in the form of a girl.  
      Mettagali madam, I don’t know why I cried for you, but you’re the first woman I ever cried for after my mom. Literally, you mean so much to me and I never want to lose you.  
      Please don’t make it harder between us. Nang gothu yene adhru sari madkothivi antha, but baya nange yeli that I’ll lose you. Nin thara hudgi nan nija yelu sikila nodu elaa.  
      I just want you to remain the same—understanding and caring. Nang kushi aguthe nan helaku munche ne nin yelaa maddagaa. I wish to marry you and let us have two babies okay. yenadru agli rich aagbitoo nina karkond hogthini hangu nim maneli opnilaa andre odi hogonna barthya ??, Nan math keldhaga, enge eranna yene adru bitkodadhu beda. Nodu nan antha gandu sigalaaa bega madve agbidhadhaa. 
      like seriously nin "Will you marry me ?" antha keldaga nange karkond hogi 3 gantuuuu hakbidanna ansthithoo.
      You’re truly one of a kind, and I value you more than I can express here.
